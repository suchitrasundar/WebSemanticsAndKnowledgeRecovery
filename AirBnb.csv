With plenty of neighborhood restaurants and bars, you can always find a place to get some food or a drink as well. Please feel free to ask for recommendations or more info about the neighborhood.","As noted, the building is blocks from the lightrail.

If you are  booking on behalf of a friend or partner we prefer that you either have a joint profile or at least provide the full name of the person(s) you are traveling with/booking for. That said, we are not uptight in the least but are not late night partiers. Also, not super early risers. Our guests should feel free to keep whatever hours they please, so long as they are reasonably quiet coming and going in the late night or very early morning. We are perfectly fine with marijuana being legal and understand that many visitors to Denver are here to enjoy it. However, for liability reasons and out of respect for our neighbours and other guests we ask that you not partake on the property. I also recently kicked a longtime tobacco habit and therefore ask no cigarette smokers either.*****In regards to the consumption of Cannabis products. We are all adults, we are not your parents, and what happens at Red Rocks is none of our bussiness.
